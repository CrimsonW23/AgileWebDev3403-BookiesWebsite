# Bookies Website Overview
- Individual profiles with individual win loss records
- Public data of wins/losses for everyone to see

## Phase 1: Basic Structure & User Management
- User Registration & Login – Allow users to create accounts and log in to get their personalized data.
- Profile Management – Let users update their details (Nickname, profile picture).
- Public Sitewide Data – Wins/losses, or some more specific snapshots of big/hype games

## Phase 2: Core Bookies System
- **Categories** – Each type of sport has its own category, sorted in reverse chronological order
- **Game View** – Basic info, expand for more details & odds (for registered users only)
- **Currency** – Use fake currency (so we don’t end up in jail)
- **Discussion forum** – Separate categories for sport types

## Phase 3: Data Visualization
- Data is tracked both as a whole and on an individual account basis
- Users logged in will be able to access their own total wins, total losses, net profit, win rate (maybe divided by sport types) in numerical and graph form, with the graph showing historical data
- For publicly available data, can have a graph/graphic with total amount of transactions in the last 24hrs/week/month or show specific big games and the stats of that
- For game specific data, expand the completed game to show the stats of the total bets made on it

## Phase 4: Social Aspect
- Having a forum allows and encourages people to discuss their views/thoughts on games and predict their outcomes
- Can also make it possible to share games that are interesting to you as a link to others that may be interested
